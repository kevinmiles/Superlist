ClickAndQuery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ClickAndQuery is a quick way to execute common queries for SQL Server, the queries 
can have tags of the form ${Some Tag}, when executed ClickAndQuery will ask you to 
enter tags values. I use it to execute queries against our FeedGhost application 
database for common queries like finding user details and checking synchronization 
statistics. If you install ClickAndQuery rather than building it then file associations 
are created with .DBQuery extension files (of course you can do this manually if you want). 
This way you can just double click on queries and they run with the option of bringing up a 
tag value requester dialog if tags are within the query.

Connection Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before you can execute a query you’ll need to enter some connection details. The connection 
details dialog can be found under the "Query->Connection Details" menu. Note that if you choose 
the “SQL Server Authentication” option then your password will be stored in the .DBQuery file; 
you can change this however by entering a tag like ${password} in the passwords place. 
When the query is executed you will be prompted for the password together with any other tags 
you’ve placed in the connection details dialog or query.

The Query Pane
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can enter any standard SQL in the query pane (with optional tags)that will execute 
against a SqlDataReader.

Examples
~~~~~~~~
SELECT * FROM [user] WHERE username = 'leea' 

or with tags:

SELECT * FROM [user] WHERE username = '${Username}' 

In this example a tag value requester dialog will popup prior to the query executing. After
you fill in the values the tags will be replaced verbatim with the value supplied and the
query will would be executed.


Notes
~~~~~
ClickAndQuery doesn't support multiple result sets, also there is no warning to save on closing 
the application if you've made changes.
